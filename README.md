# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing and Its Importance
Wireframing is the skeletal framework of a project where the fundamental structural layout of an application or website is developed. It focuses on element placement, navigation flow, and the overall user interface structure. It usually contains minimal details about design elements like colours, fonts, and images.

Having a wireframe brings clarity to the ideas and concepts at hand. It further improves communication among the team, as it serves as a guide to the design process. Time and resources are better managed with wireframing, and modifications are easier to make.

## Key Elements Found in Wireframing

* **Layout Structure**: This entails defining how elements are arranged on various pages and how they relate to each other.  
  _E.g., Where the logo will be and where the navigation bar will appear on different screens._

* **Navigation**: This indicates how users move from one section to another. It shows the flow of movement within the application.  
  _E.g., How a user can quickly navigate from any page to the home screen._

* **Content Placement**: This shows where elements like images, text, and buttons will be positioned within the application or website.  
  _E.g., How text and images are laid out and where buttons are placed._

* **Functionality**: This outlines how key functionalities and interactions will work within the website or application.  
  _E.g., How a payment process will function._

## Types of Wireframes

* **Low-Fidelity Wireframe**: A wireframe with simple, basic sketches or digital layouts focusing on the general structure without detailed design elements.  
  This is mostly used in the early stages to get basic ideas down quickly, with fewer distractions from design details.

* **High-Fidelity Wireframe**: A wireframe with more detail, closely resembling the final design. It includes elements like colours, fonts, and images to give a realistic representation of the finished product.  
  This is typically created toward the end of the wireframing phase, once all stakeholders are aligned.

## The Type of Wireframe Shown
This is a **high-fidelity wireframe** because it goes beyond providing a structural layout. Font sizes and types, images, and colours are carefully considered to present a close approximation of how the final product will look.

## Tools for Wireframing
There are numerous tools for wireframing, such as **Draw.io**, **Figma**, **Balsamiq**, and more. While all these tools are effective, **Figma** stands out in my opinion. It offers a free version that is quite powerful, and you can even begin with ready-made templates if preferred.

Sharing and collaboration are simple since it’s a browser-based tool, making it highly accessible. Figma is suitable for both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframing. To get the full experience, give it a try.

## Benefits of Wireframing
Wireframing provides a clear visual roadmap of the project, ensuring that the entire team understands exactly what to do. This clarity helps save time and resources, while also helping to identify and mitigate potential usability issues early—**before development begins**.

It ensures that everything needed in the design phase is accounted for. Questions and confusion are resolved ahead of time, so by the time development starts, everyone is aligned on what needs to be built.

## Real-World Scenario
In the process of building an e-commerce website, a user had to tap on a *Read More* button to see reviews and the number of views for the item they were viewing. Through effective communication, the project manager was notified—along with real-world examples and research findings to support the feedback—that users should be able to see an item’s reviews, number sold, rating, and likes at first glance.

By using wireframing, potential usability issues were addressed early on, and the structure was adjusted to better align with user needs.
