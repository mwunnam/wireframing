# Wireframing
## What is wireframing and its importance
Wireframing is the skeletal framework of the project where fundamental structural layout of the application or website is developed. It focuses on element placement, navigation flow, and the overall user interface structure. It usually contain minimal details about design elements like colours, fonts, and images.
Having a wireframe brings clarity to the ideas and concepts at hand, this futher improves communication among the team as it serves as the guide to the design process. Time and resources are better managed with wireframing and modifications are easier to make.

## Key Elements Found In Wireframing
* Layout structure:     This entails the defininig of the way elements are arranged on the various pages, and how they relate to each other. 
_E.g., Where the logo will be, and where the navigation bar will be on different screens._

* Navigation:   This indicates how users will move from one section to the other. It shows the flow of movement by the user. 
_E.g., How to move quickly from anywhere on the application to home._ 

* Content Placement:    This shows where elements will be positioned 
_E.g., How images and text will be laid out, how buttons will be placed in the application or website._

* Functionality:    This shows how key functionalities and interaction will work within the website or application. 
_E.g., How a payment functionality will work._

## Types of Wireframes
* Low-fidelity Wireframe:   A wireframe with simple and basic sketches or digital layout focusing on the general structure without design details.
This is mostly used in the early stages to get basic ideas down quickly with less distraction from details.

* High-fidelity Wireframe:  A wirefram with more details which is most likely close to the final design. It indicates the final design with colours, fonts, images to make it look more like the finished product. This is mostly done at the end where all stakeholders are in agreement with everything.

## The Type of Wireframe Show
This is a high-fidelity wireframing because it goes beyoud giving the structural layout of the website. Font sizes and types, images, and colours are taken into consideration. This shows how the final product should look.
